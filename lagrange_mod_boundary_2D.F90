! Boundary: only 2D grid

! Oct 26
! First, plume injected into an Eulerian grid cell and cover some space from
! Eulerian grid cell. Once the plume occupy some space, the plume space will
! become isolated and have boundary with the Eulerian grid cell. The Eulerian
! grid cell will have less space. When dissolve the plume into host Eulerian
! grid cell, the two spaces will be combined into one space.

! Jan 17, 2022
! add a new output text file about the aerosol concentration for the aerosol
! size distribution plot validation



! New version
! use linked link to store injected plumes' character(concentration, location,
! etc.)
! this version could successfully run !!!


! 1. dissolve plume once hitting tropopause

! 2. add variable 'N_split' to define the number of small parts after 
!    plume split

! 3. Oct 9th, 2020 
!  Update the horizontal stretch code, originally the horizontal plume segment is
!  calculated based on adjacent segments, but this requires all the plume
!  segments are exit in the whole simulation without dissolving. The new code
!  will calculate the horizontal stretch based on the center and one endpoint 
!  (box_lat_edge, box_lon_edge) of the segment, which will not rely on the
!   adjacent segment any more.

! 4. Oct 9th, 2020
! Assume that the box_length would not change because of PV=nRT, 
! only the plume cross-section will be used to represent the volume change because
! of PV=nRT

! 5. Oct 10th, 2020
! Add Third judge in 2D cross-section model.
! At the end of simulation, not only the 1D slab model will dissolve, 2D model
! will also dissolve.

! 6. Oct 10th, 2020
! Inn stead of using adjacent plume segment, the box_alpha is calculated based
! on the center and one endpoint inside one plume segment

! 7. Oct 12nd, 2020
! delete the output for grid area (State_Met_AREA_M2.txt), since this variable
! can be found in the formal output as "AREA".

! 8. Oct 12nd, 2020
! correct the runge-kutta method for advection process (dx/dt=u).
! since the wind speed is 3-h average value, assume wind speed is independent of
! time, only change with locations [u(z,y,x) instead of u(t,z,y,x)]
! RK_Dlev(Ki) = RK_Dt(1) * curr_omeg / 100.0 

! 9. Oct 12nd, 2020
! use runge-kutta method when calcualte box_u(i_box), box_v(i_box),
! box_omeg(i_box)

! 10. Oct 12nd, 2020
! modify the box_alpha and ensure the wind speed along plume cross-section is
! correct. range of box_alpha is [PI, -PI)

! 11. Oct 12nd, 2020
! modify the 1D slab model splitting, correct the box_lon and  box_lon_edge 
! for the new plume after splitting
! to get the correct new box_lon, box_length should times COS(box_alpha) first.

! 12. Oct 13rd, 2020
! correct the calculate for plume splitting box_lon and box_lat, as well as
! box_lon_edge and box_lat_edge.

! Oct 15th, 2020
! add forth judge to 2D cross-section model, let plume dissolve when transport
! from stratosphere into troposphere.

! Nov 1st, 2020
! Instead of setting Pdt=10s, adjust Pdt based on the CFL condition in 2D grids.
!
! Dt2 for 1D grid can only be 60s as minimum. If a less than 60s values is
! needed for Dt2, let 1D slab begin to combine 2 grid cells into 1 grid cell.

! Nov 2, 2020
! Correct the injected aerosol concentration at the beginning
! pay attention to the unit

! Nov 2, 2020
! Add Xscale and Yscale for 2D grid, which can be used to identify the box_theta
! value, when concentratino don't follow gaussian distribution after involve
! settling speed etc.
! 
! when change 2D to 1D, not use degree to judge, but use length (Xscale, Yscale) 
! containing 95% mass to judge

! Nov 3, 2020
! add a lifetime variable Lifetime(n_box) to record the plume lifetim in plume
! model. When lifetime is larger than 3 hours, begin to consider change 2D to 1D
! change Sigma2D to lifetime

! Nov 3, 2020
! redifine LenB = Pdy(Ibox) in Slab_init() function,
! set n_slab_max = 300, which is close to n_y_max;

! Nov 7, 2020
! 1. DlonN, DlatN are corrected: the circumference of the lat circle is 2*pi*r,
! instead of 2*pi*r**2 !!!
!
! 2. check the shadow plume, to ensure the total mass is conseved 
! Mr + Mb = (Mp - Ms) + Mb = (Mp + D_Mp) - (Ms + D_Ms) + [Mb - ( D_Mp - D_Ms)]
! Mr: total mass of the real plume;
! Mp: total mass of the plume model in the code;
! Ms: total mass of the shadow plume model in the code;
! Mb: total mass of the background grid cell containing plume model
! D_Mp: change mass after one time step in plume model
! D_Ms: change mass after one time step in shadow plume model

! Nov 8, 2020
! Instead of using 2nd order chemical reaction to decide the initail lenght of
! 1D grid, use the lenght containing 95% of total mass.

! Nov 11, 2020
! add following code to check cpu time for each section of code:
!       call cpu_time(start)
!       put code to test here
!       call cpu_time(finish)
!       print '("Time = ",f6.3," seconds.")',finish-start

! Nov 11, 2020
! CFL_2d is added to speed up the code in advection in 2D grid model

! Nov 14, 2020
! the concentration will change after the volume change because of idea gas law
! (PV=nRT)

! Nov 14, 2020
! track the whole lifetime of the first plume segment to check:
! (1) shadow plume model performance;
! (2) evolution of the plume is reasonable;

! Nov 16, 2020
! delete shadow plume model, replace by a exrta mass container
!
! reset the injected aerosol concentration in GCM model in lagrangain_initial
! module, to make sure the background concentration is 0 at beginning.
!
! For changing from 2D to 1D in function Interplt_2D() in module Slab_init(), 
! when the interpolate point is out of 2D grid, instead of setting as 0, set 
! as background concentration.
!       IF(Ix0<=1 .or. Ix0>=n_x_max-1)THEN
!        Interplt_2D = 0.0e+0_fp

! Nov 17, 2020
! Add two processes:
! When combine 9 to 1 grid cell in 2D grid model, extra mass will increase.
! When combine 2 to 1 grid cell in 1D grid model, extra mass will increase.

! Nov 19, 2020
! assume plume segment lenght is always along the background wind direction, so
! the box_alpha is calculated based on the background wind speed now.
!
! use Lyapunov component (Ly) to calculate the horizontal stretch of the plume
! segment.
!
! delete the box_lon_edge(i_box), box_lat_edge(i_box), box_lev_edge(i_box)

! Nov 21, 2020
! modify the next_i_lon and next_i_lat to ensure they are in the range of 
! [1, IIPAR/JJPAR].
!
!        if(next_i_lon>IIPAR) next_i_lon=next_i_lon-IIPAR
!        if(next_i_lon<1) next_i_lon=next_i_lon+IIPAR
!
!        if(next_i_lat>JJPAR) next_i_lat=JJPAR
!        if(next_i_lat<1) next_i_lat=1

! Nov 27, 2020
!
! update the 1D grid domain, make sure the number of 1D grid cell cam be divided
! by 4, to ensure n_slab_25 is an integer.
!
! add a new variable n_slab_max2=n_slab_max, Concnt1D_bdy(n_slab_max2), to add
! two more grid cell temporarily when calculate the diffusion process inside 1D
! grid.
!       Concnt1D_bdy(1)          = backgrd_concnt
!       Concnt1D_bdy(n_slab_max2) = backgrd_concnt
!       Concnt1D_bdy(2:n_slab_max2-1) = box_concnt_1D(i_box,1:n_slab_max,1)

! Nov 29, 2020
! find the error about total injected mass increasing in plume model:
! box_Ra and box_Rb are commented previously. So only box_length keeps
! increasing. Volume is not conserved.
!      length0           = box_length(i_box)
!      box_length(i_box) = EXP(Ly*Dt) * box_length(i_box)

!
! ERROR: total mass is not conservsed between Plume model and Eulerian model
! Check the third judgement:
! ERROR solved by 
! changing  "IF ( ITS_TIME_FOR_EXIT() ) THEN" 
! to        "IF(DAY==31 .and. HOUR==23)THEN"

! Dec 5, 2020
! add bondary grid cell to 2D grid, similar like what we did for 1D grid.
! By doing so, the boundary of plume would not belong to plume mass, when 
! combine plume grid cells (9 to 1, 2 to 1), these extra mass in plume 
! boundary grid cell will be included.
!
! the dimension order of box_concnt_2D and box_concnt_1D are changed, "n_box"
